Daydream, i fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours on a beautiful day
Daydream, i dreamed of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, such a beautiful day!
I dreamed of the places i've been with you
How we sat with the stream flowing by
And then when i kissed you and held you
So near tell me why, tell me why you're so shy?
Daydream, i fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours on a beautiful day
Daydream, come share a dream amid the flowers
For a couple of hours on a beautiful day
I dreamed of the places i've been with you
How we sat with the stream flowing by
And then when i kissed you and held you so near
Tell me why, tell me why you're so shy?
Daydream, i sing with you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, singing all of the day
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
