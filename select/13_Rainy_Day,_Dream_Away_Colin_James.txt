[Original by Jimi Hendrix]

Rainy day, rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away yeah

Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey
Lay back and dream on a rainy day

Dream away, dream all day
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away

Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day

Rainy day dream away
Dream all day
Dream all day
Dream away

Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
